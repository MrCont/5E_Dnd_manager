This is my first serious work on GitHub while I am still learning howto use it.
hopefully this would make someone else`s life easier

# LICENSE CHOICE

I have opted for a cc-by-nc-sa license since I would love to share the work with other people and I strongly believe that projects like this one should be free to use.

I am sure this and any possible derivative could never be the next major application on the market.

I don't like the idea of commercial purpouse for any derivatives of this project, since DnD works with fantasy which, to my mind, needs to be kept free and still I haven't found a free license that does it :)
