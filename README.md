# 5E_Dnd
A simple tool to make your DnD adventure boring preparation quicker thanks to python.

hopefully this would make someone else`s life easier.

# Warning:
CURRENTLY THE APP IS NOT READY TO USE

This is my first kinda-serious work on GitHub while I am still learning how to code an how to use git, therefore you are likely to be exposed to a pletora of bad commits and weird code (forewarned, forearmed).

# LICENSE CHOICE

i have used pyside2 module and as far as I know it's under LGPL which means I can choose the licensei want since this app only "use" it.

I have opted for a cc-by-nc-sa license since I would love to share the work with other people and I strongly believe that projects like this one should be free to use.

I am sure this and any possible derivative could never be the next major application on the market.

I don't like the idea of commercial purpouse for any derivatives of this project, since DnD works with fantasy which, to my mind, needs to be kept free.
Still I haven't found a free license that does it :)
