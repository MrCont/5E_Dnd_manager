# LICENSE CHOICE
I have opted for a cc-by-nc-sa license since I would love to share the work with other people and I strongly believe that projects like this one should be free to use.
I am sure this and any possible derivative could never be the next major application on the market.
I don't like the idea of commercial purpouse for any deivatives of this project, since DnD works with fantasy which, o my mind, needds to be kept free
