# 5E_Dnd
A simple tool to make your DnD adventure boring preparation quicker thanks to python.

hopefully this would make someone else`s life easier.

# Requirements
this list is still far to be completed
 - Python 3+
 - pyside2
 - reportlab
 - pypdf2
 
# How to
at the moment u can try the application by cloning the repo and then running main_GUI.py

# Warning:
APPLICATION IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT

This is my first kinda-serious work on GitHub while I am still learning how to code an how to use git, therefore you are likely to be exposed to a pletora of bad commits and weird code (forewarned, forearmed).
